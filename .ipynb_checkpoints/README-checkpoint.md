# Module_10_Challenge

Using the outline provided through Jupyter Notebook, in this challenge, we used price change data of crypto currencies at various time intervals to compare K-Means clustering models with full features and PCA aided reduced features. 

With fewer features using PCA to cluster the data has given a more visually compact cluster and  clear outliers. With 89.5% of variance explained by the PCA components, using fewer features to cluster data might address concerns of over-fitting the data and at the same time not under-fitting.
